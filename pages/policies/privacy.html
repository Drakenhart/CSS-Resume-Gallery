to our privacy policy and agree to its terms.

If you have any issue with this Privacy Policy, or it’s sister policies, you retain the right to discontinue

<h2 id="specs">Specifications</h2>

This Privacy Policy document describes in detail the policies and procedures in regards to the types of personal visitor 
information collected and recorded, and how that information is stored and used. Currently this Privacy Policy applies 
only to our *online activities*. It is valid for visitors to our *website*, *newsletter*, and *live streaming activities*, 
regarding information shared and/or collected there. This policy does not (as yet) apply to any information collected offline 
or via channels other than what listed above. 

> *IMPORTANT:* I do not purposefully sell any information to third parties, be they affiliates or general advertisers. I dislike 
> that kind of behavior when it is done to me, so I refuse to do it to others.

### Collecting Personal Data

Art-Geek-Design collects personal information in order to conduct our business. We understand that much of this is sensitive data, 
and do not share it intentionally with other third party companies without your direct and knowing consent. Art-Geek-Design does not 
sell, lease, or rent any of this personal information nor its customer lists with any outside third parties.

Some of the site's third-party plugins (example: blog comment system) may collect data from this site in order to do their 
business, but the information regarding our visitors is more general (Example: Google analytics - site click-through ratios, etc).

### Offers, Notifications, and Newsletter

Art-Geek-Design may from time to time contact our customers through our newsletter with new services, updates or upgrades in services, or other similar 
new offers. These are rare, and can be opted-out by either unsubscribing from the newsletter, or simply ignoring the notifications, offer,
or request – that works too!

If there is a business, offer, site, or other resource we think our customers may benefit from, we may send you the site and 
contact information. Some of these may be affiliate links, others may be non-affiliate links and as such will be noted in the 
communication sent out to our client base. We, however, *will not share your information with them*, nor sign you up for any of 
their offers. That is your choice to make.

### Our Promise

Art-Geek-Design will not release nor share any specific private information, either publicly or privately, in regards to race, religion, belief, culture, 
or political affiliation - with two exceptions. Our business is not the business of  information brokering. Though we may collect it from time to time, 
it is merely for our own use as statistical or research purposes alone (mostly in regards to what services, artwork, etc, we might offer our 
client base). If we request such information, or it is sent to us as part of a site design, other job, or other artwork, it will not 
be shared as noted above.

#### *Exceptions*

If in event of a demand by law enforcement, Art-Geek-Design will only release personal information, and this may be without notice, if so required by law, or in good faith that it is in fact necessary.  
Such “Good Faith Release” includes such instances as; (1) the need to comply with certain legal actions or responses as required of Ms. Bryant or her Sites, (2) when in defense of Art-Geek-Design 
or any of it’s property, (3) in acting under specific instances in order to protect customers and/or the public.

Art-Geek-Design will contact said parties in such cases as soon as humanly possible, unless we are held by a Gag Order, 
or similar legally binding request.

<h2 id="cookies">Cookies</h2>

<h2 id="userinfo">User Provided Information</h2>

You provide me with information about yourself, your personal or business website, and sometimes other links to various social 
media accounts under your control when you comment. Email correspondence to me, my responses, and any shared files may be 
retained for future needs.

<h2 id="log">Log Files</h2>

Like many other Web sites, Art-Geek-Design makes use of log files. These files merely log a users visit to the site and how they 
interact with the website in question. This is generally a standard procedure for hosting companies and a part of hosting services’s 
analytics. The information inside the log files includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), 
date/time stamp, referring/exit pages, and  the number of clicks a user makes while visiting the site.

This information is used to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement around the site, and gather demographic 
information. IP addresses, and other such information are not linked to any information that is personally identifiable. This 
information helps drakenhart-studios.net to improve and streamline a visitor’s interaction, and hopefully improve both information 
flow and sales by providing visitors with the best possible user experience we are able to provide.

<h2 id="child">Child Privacy</h2>

Art-Geek-Design believes it is important to provide added protection for children online. We encourage parents and guardians to spend 
time online with their children to observe, participate in and/or monitor and guide their online activity.

Art-Geek-Design does not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information (PII) from children under the age of 13. 
If a parent or guardian believes that Art-Geek-Design has in this site’s database the personally-identifiable information of a child 
under the age of 13, please contact Ms. Bryant immediately and she will use her best efforts to promptly remove such information 
from the site’s records.
