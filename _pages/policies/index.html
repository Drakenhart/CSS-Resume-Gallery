## Affiliate Obligations

Art-Geek-Design tries to stay compliant with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) guidelines on testimonials and endorsements. All 
endorsements, reviews, testimonials on Drakenhart-Studio.net’s products, and services, as well as relationships between other types
of content websites (forums, blogs, microblogs and other Social Media channels) and Art-Geek-Design (Ms. Hope Bryant) must be clearly 
disclosed in a separate policy on the affiliate sites. FTC points out that “when there exists a connection between the endorser 
and the seller of the advertised product” it is imperative that such connection is “fully disclosed”. FTC deems the relationship in 
an endorser-sponsor light, and believes that the end user has the right to understand that one exists. See the [full text here](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/ftcs-endorsement-guides-what-people-are-asking) 
with a .pdf download from the FTC.gov website. We share the under-girding idea of this approach, and strongly encourage our affiliates 
to adhere to the FTC’s rules. We also reserve the right to terminate relationship with any non-compliant affiliates.
