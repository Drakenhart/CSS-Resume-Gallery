### Content Creator Statement
As a content provider, and general nerd that loves sharing information, 
I am happy and grateful to be of service in bringing you the primary content 
on this site free of charge. However, such content does not pay the bills, so 
in order to continue this service I have monetized several aspects of this site. 
Please note, when you click links to other Third Party merchants or vendors 
(and is some cases buy items), there is a good chance that I receive a referral commission. 
I have made sure that pages, posts, and links that are affliate links are clearly noted.

Your personal support through purchasing items or services via these links allows me to keep my over-all art sales, 
private comissions, and private tutoring class prices low. The small percentage that is added to my income also helps 
pays some of my bills, and empowers me to share more delicious nerd-ery goodness through my blog with less worry, stress, 
and hassle. Thank you!

Any of the opinions expressed here are those of myself, and are not necessarily the opinions of, nor reflected views from, 
any of the merchants or other third-party vendors with which I am affiliated  I take my critiques and reviews seriously.
I only add affiliate links in my review posts to those products or services I fully believe in and whole-heartedly endorse, 
because I either use them myself or have witnessed their usefulness.
